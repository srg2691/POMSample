Docker Commands

Docker pull - pulls only the image from Docker hub repository

Docker run - pulls the image and creates a container

docker run -d -p 80:80 docker/getting-started

if ran another time, creates a second container on top of same image

docker images - to know how many images are created in docker desktop

docker ps -a - tells you how many containers are running in my system

docker run -d -p 82:82 --name sarang docker/getting-started - creates a container with name ' sarang'

docker restart ecf4e8cd249f OR "container name" - restarts the container (VM)

docker stop 975294a1e4a2 - shuts down the container, docker kill will also exit the container

docker start 975294a1e4a2 - starts the container

docker rm 975294a1e4a2 - removed the container (cannot remove a running container, need to stop it first)

docker stop 975294a1e4a2  - will stop the container


docker ps - give me the info of the running containers only


docker rmi 3e4394f6b72f - removes the image (but cannot remove , without first stopping and then deleting the containers first)


docker run -d -p 80:80 docker/getting-started - -p is for port
-d is for detach mode - means once command is run , free the cmd to run the next command


docker run  -p 80:80 --name anand docker/getting-started - run the command in non detach mode, cannot run the next command
because of non detach mode, so always use the command with -d, else we need to open a new cmd window

docker logs 0af3a6cae03a --- to check the logs of a particular container


docker run -d -p 80:80 --name selenium <image name>


docker system prune -a ---this command will delete all the images and all the containers , first stop all the containers 

C:\Users\sanand>docker system prune -a
WARNING! This will remove:
  - all stopped containers
  - all networks not used by at least one container
  - all images without at least one container associated to them
  - all build cache
